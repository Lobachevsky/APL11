# APL11
`APL\11` circa 1977

This code and documentation has been placed here so that it does not get lost forever.  

Note that this version is written in pre-`K&R C` and will probably not compile with any modern C compiler. 

I worked on a similar version of `APL\11` in the mid 1970s and was able to get it to compile and work with an early 1980s vintage `K&R C` compiler.  (I had to replace a =+ 1; by a += 1; but otherwise it ported easily)

Read [crm.pdf](https://github.com/Lobachevsky/APL11/blob/master/crm.pdf) and [arrow.pdf](https://github.com/Lobachevsky/APL11/blob/master/arrow.pdf) for 
more background and information on pre-`K&R C`.
