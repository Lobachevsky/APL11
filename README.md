# APL11
APL\11 circa 1977

This code and documentation has been placed here so that it does not get lost forever.  

Note that this version is written in pre-K&R C and will probably not compile with any modern C compiler. 

I worked on a version of this in the mid 1970s and was able to get it to compile and work with an early 1980s vintage K&R C compiler.  (I had to replace a =+ 1; by a += 1; but otherwise it ported easily)

more background and information.
